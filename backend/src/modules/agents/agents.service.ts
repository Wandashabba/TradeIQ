 * query, or stops merged from two sources) would make this function report
 * a confidently wrong outlet with no throw and no signal. A redundant sort
 * over a day's worth of stops (tens of rows) is free next to that risk.
 *
 * Three states, not four. #153's sketch proposed an `offline` state, but T0
 * has no heartbeat — it cannot tell "phone is off" from "driving between
 * stores". Reporting `offline` would assert something we do not observe.
